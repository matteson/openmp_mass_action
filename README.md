openmp_mass_action
==================

This project is a MATLAB to C translator for MATLAB SimBiology mass-action models.  For models that need to be
repeatedly simulated with different parameters or initial conditions it can run in parallel using OpenMP.  It employs
the SUNDIALS CVODE Solver (https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/main.html) to solve the ODE system generated
from the SimBiology reactions.

Given many conditions to simulate (parameters or initial conditions) and sufficient threads the code generated by this
project can outperform MATLAB's compiled sbiosimulate command in absolute time for certain classes of models (especially
those in Andrew's dissertation).  Certain operations in solving the ODEs including Jacobian operations and preconditioning
the Jacobian solver have been optimized to have a small memory footpritn (generally in the L2 cache for most model/processor
combos).

Examples:
These would be nice

Note on condition of code:
This code should be considered research quality (that's a polite way of saying just shy of an alpha release).  Errors
caused by improper use may error silently.  Accuracy has been rigorously assesed for the models in the Andrew's thesis,
but untested edge cases could potentially have unexpected results.


The code was developed as part of the doctoral dissertation of Andrew Matteson at New York University.
